      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>My name is Kevin and I'm born and raised in Orange County.
        I finished my undergraduate at UCSD, studying computer science. 
        Iâ€™m a very easygoing and sociable guy, and I love talking and meeting new people. 
        I've been cutting hair for 5 years now and still going.
       Besides barbering, I enjoy playing games (League of Legends, CoD, etc), hooping, 
       dancing, and coding!</p>

      <p>It all started with me trying to save 
        money for college by learning to cut my own hair on youtube. Safe to say, the haircuts I gave myself were absolutely horrible. 
        I had a thought that I could learn quicker by cutting my highschool buddies and cousins.
        So thats what I did, and I quickly came to the realization that cutting hair would be one of my passions! I think being able to give other people the confidence boost to pursue their goals and to meet all 
        sorts of people and listen their unique stories really sold it for me.
